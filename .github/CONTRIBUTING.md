# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for interest in supporting the development of the Goji data analysis notebook! Here are some guidelines to help facilitate contributing to the code base.

## What's good to contribute

- Reporting bugs is the best way to contribute.
- Reporting new data sources or companies (describe the addition through a feature request).
- Fixing bugs you find or any of the open [issues](https://github.com/getgoji/goji-data-analysis/issues)
- Performance improvements are always welcome.

## What about features?

It's best to leave features as requests and we will decided if they make sense to add to the project.
